    As an expert intraday trading analyst for the Indian market (NSE), provide a concise market overview.
    1.  **Market Trend:** What is the current NIFTY 50 trend (e.g., bullish, bearish, sideways) based on today's early trading?
    2.  **Top 3 Momentum Stocks:** Suggest three NIFTY 50 stocks showing strong intraday momentum (either up or down). For each, provide the stock name, a brief rationale (e.g., "breaking key resistance", "high volume sell-off"), and a potential direction.
    3.  **Key Sector:** Mention one sector that is particularly active today.

    Format your response as clean markdown.

    I am planning an intraday trade in the Indian market. Here are the details:
    - **Stock:** ${stock}
    - **Trade Type:** ${tradeType}
    - **Entry Price:** â‚¹${entryPrice}
    - **Quantity:** ${quantity} shares
    - **My Expected Direction:** ${expectedDirection}
    ${customLevels}
    - **My Personal Strategy:** I prefer to exit by 1:00 PM IST if the trade is still open, unless my stop-loss or target is hit first.

    Based on this, provide a concise, actionable trading strategy covering these points:
    1.  **Initial Strategy:** Given my parameters, is this a sound entry? Provide a brief confirmation or a word of caution, especially considering my custom stop-loss/target if provided.
    2.  **Risk Management:** Analyze my stop-loss (custom or default). Is it appropriate for this stock's volatility today? Suggest an adjustment if necessary.
    3.  **Exit Strategy:** Incorporate my 1:00 PM IST exit rule and my target price. Recommend any other condition-based exits to consider.
    4.  **Confidence Score:** Provide a confidence score (out of 10) for this trade's success based on my strategy and custom levels.

    Keep the advice practical for a retail intraday trader. Format as clean markdown.
